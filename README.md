# PAI Lab Fourth Assignment: JSON File Handling.

JSON file handling and Array method's practice. Strings are practiced too. FileSystem and Readline API are included by Node.js and they are also used intensely in this assignment.

This directory is organised as follows:

```
  .
  ├── docs          # Documentation and tutorials
  ├── resources     # Resources used for the assignment
  ├── src           # Source code
  ├── tutorials     # Tutorials about stuff necessary for the completion of the assignment
  ├── bin           # Executable scripts

```
### Summary

Initially tasks necessary to implement wc were defined:

Tasks:
- Obtain input from terminal
- Obtain the file's content as a string
- Process the string to obtain the lines, words and characters.

Testing of FileSystem functions started while filling up JSDoc tutorials for display on the documentation page. Various functions were defined using each of the core functions from fs; 
 - readFile
 - readdir
 - stat
 - rename
 - unlink

 All while preparing the overall structure of the project. JSDoc config file setup and separation of source code files on modules for testing different parts of the FileSystem API. Initially tutorials is given a main focus in an attempt to minimize confusion. Eslint was also configured as always.
